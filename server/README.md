# Bayon Client Backend Server

A lightweight, production-ready Node.js & Express backend for **Bayon Client** featuring:
- **Friends & Presence API** (`GET /api/friends`, `POST /api/friends`, `PATCH /api/friends/:id/presence`, `DELETE /api/friends/:id`)
- **Authentication & Accounts** (`POST /api/auth/register`, `POST /api/auth/login`, `GET /api/auth/me`)
- **Bacoins & Cosmetics** (authenticated balances, redeem claims, and server-checked purchases)
- **Health Check** (`GET /api/health`)
- **CORS Configured** for Electron and Vite desktop clients
- **Render Blueprint ready** configured for the **Singapore** region (`singapore`)

## Deploy to Render (Singapore)

### Option A: Using Render Blueprints (Recommended)
1. Push your repository to **GitHub**.
2. Go to the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com).
3. Click **New +** → **Blueprint**.
4. Connect your GitHub repository.
5. Render will automatically detect [`render.yaml`](../render.yaml) at the repository root and configure:
   - **Name**: `bayon-backend`
   - **Region**: `Singapore` (`singapore`)
   - **Root Directory**: `server`
   - **Plan**: `Free`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
6. Click **Apply**. Render will build and deploy your service.
7. Copy your assigned service URL (e.g. `https://bayon-backend.onrender.com`).

### Option B: Manual Web Service on Render
If you prefer creating a Web Service manually:
1. Go to **New +** → **Web Service**.
2. Connect your repo and fill in:
   - **Name**: `bayon-backend`
   - **Region**: **Singapore (Southeast Asia)**
   - **Root Directory**: `server`
   - **Runtime**: `Node`
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
   - **Plan**: `Free`
3. Add Environment Variable:
   - `JWT_SECRET`: (Enter a random secret string)
   - `BACOIN_ADMIN_KEY`: (Use a separate random secret; keep it private)
4. Click **Create Web Service**.

## Bacoins and redeem codes

To connect an offline Minecraft profile, select it in **Accounts**, open the **Minecraft / Java Edition** dropdown in the title bar, enter an email address, and request a verification code. Enter the six-digit code from that inbox to link the verified address to the selected profile. The Store contains no account password form; Bayon never asks for an email password or reads inbox contents. A code is single-use, expires after 10 minutes, and can be requested again after one minute. Each offline profile can be linked to one Bayon account, and Bacoins and cosmetic purchases stay with that Bayon account.

Email sign-in uses [Resend's email API](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/emails/send-email). Configure these variables in the backend service environment (for example, Render) and verify the sender domain/address with Resend:

- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Resend API key. Keep it on the server; never put it in the launcher or commit it to source control.
- `BACOIN_EMAIL_FROM`: verified sender, for example `Bayon Client <login@your-verified-domain.com>`.

Until both are configured on the deployed backend, requesting a code returns an email-not-configured error. Google OAuth endpoints remain available as an optional alternative, but the app's Bacoins sign-in uses the email code flow.
The Store currently accepts redeem codes and sells the configured cosmetics. Payment processing is not enabled.

Create codes from a trusted administrator machine. The key is read from `BACOIN_ADMIN_KEY`; never put it in the launcher or commit it to source control. Returned plaintext codes are shown once, so save them securely:

```powershell
$headers = @{ 'x-bayon-admin-key' = $env:BACOIN_ADMIN_KEY }
$body = @{ amount = 500; maxClaims = 1; count = 5 } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri 'https://<your-service-name>.onrender.com/api/bacoins/admin/codes' -Headers $headers -ContentType 'application/json' -Body $body
```

`amount` is the Bacoins each code grants, `maxClaims` limits the total number of accounts that may claim each code, and `count` creates that many separate codes. The database stores only a SHA-256 hash of each code. The backend currently uses its existing JSON file database; deploy it with persistent storage before relying on balances or claims for long-term production use.

## Connecting Bayon Client to Your Backend

Once your Render server is live:

1. Open your project root `.env` or `.env.local`:
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://<your-service-name>.onrender.com
   ```
2. Rebuild the launcher:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Launch the desktop app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
The Friends panel and presence features in Bayon Client will now automatically communicate with your live server in Singapore!
